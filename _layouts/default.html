        <p>
          I’m a retired police officer, Partner in a tax and accounting firm and, since I was six-years-old,
	  I have been programming computers. Starting with BASIC on a Commodore 64, then continuing on to
	  Assembly for that same architecture, I have spent a lifetime growing up with computer programming
	  as a background reality in my existence.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Since my early programming experience, I went on to learn and work in C, Python (2 and 3), Lisp,
	  Lua, as well as HTML and CSS. I have worked on volunteer projects, such as a Mandrake Linux
	  (pre-Mandriva) and Arch Linux package maintanier, as well as chasing bugs for various GitHub
	  repos. Most recently I have learned and worked in the Go programming language.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I have a high degree of mastery with the GNU/Linux operating system, and have worked extensively
	  with the Intel Edison platform as a precursor / proof of concept for embedded systems, such as
	  the Microchip PICKIT platform.
	<p>
          As a hobby, I work with both machines and electronics, and hold a General Class Amatuer Radio License
	  (KE7CJV). I have been building, maintaining, and repairing radios and computers since I was a boy.
        </p>
	<p>
	  Nothing in this world captivates and excites me like a novel challenge in the fields of computer
	  science or electronics, and the confluence of the two is my ultimate happy place!

      <strong>CREDITS</strong>
    </h1>
    <h4>
      Nicolas P. Rougier
    </h4>
    <p>
      I am deeply indebted to Nicolas P. Rougier who, in his fantastic and incredibly useful post on GTD and Org-Mode, graciously
      shared the stylesheet for his own site, much of which I have either adapted or adopted for this site. I so dearly
      love the beautiful simplicity and minimalism of his site, which draws the reader in and presents the valuable
      information he shares in a way that's free from distraction, that I was couldn't find a substantive change to make
      to improve on his design! Layout, typeset, and colors are all his creation; deceptively simple, yet profound!
    </p>
    <p>
      While I have adapted it for my own purposes, if you visit his site (<a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/">here</a>)
      you will see just how unoriginal I am!  Thank you, Nicolas, not only for your excellent article (<a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/GTD/index.html">"GET THINGS DONE WITH EMACS"</a>),
      but for your impeccable design, taste, and generousity.
    </p>
