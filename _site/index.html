        <p>
          I’m a retired police officer, Partner in a tax and accounting firm and, since I was six-years-old,
	  I have been programming computers. Starting with BASIC on a Commodore 64, then continuing on to
	  Assembly for that same architecture, I have spent a lifetime growing up with computer programming
	  as a background reality in my existence.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Since my early programming experience, I went on to learn and work in C, Python (2 and 3), Lisp,
	  Lua, as well as HTML and CSS. I have worked on volunteer projects, such as a Mandrake Linux
	  (pre-Mandriva) and Arch Linux package maintanier, as well as chasing bugs for various GitHub
	  repos. Most recently I have learned and worked in the Go programming language.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I have a high degree of mastery with the GNU/Linux operating system, and have worked extensively
	  with the Intel Edison platform as a precursor / proof of concept for embedded systems, such as
	  the Microchip PICKIT platform.
	<p>
          As a hobby, I work with both machines and electronics, and hold a General Class Amatuer Radio License
	  (KE7CJV). I have been building, maintaining, and repairing radios and computers since I was a boy.
        </p>
	<p>
	  Nothing in this world captivates and excites me like a novel challenge in the fields of computer
	  science or electronics, and the confluence of the two is my ultimate happy place!
	</p>
