      <strong>CREDITS</strong>
    </h1>
    <h4>
      Nicolas P. Rougier
    </h4>
    <p>
      I am deeply indebted to Nicolas P. Rougier who, in his fantastic and incredibly useful post on GTD and Org-Mode, graciously
      shared the stylesheet for his own site, much of which I have either adapted or adopted for this site. I so dearly
      love the beautiful simplicity and minimalism of his site, which draws the reader in and presents the valuable
      information he shares in a way that's free from distraction, that I was simply unable to find a substantive change to make
      which would improve upon the orginal. Layout, typeset, and colors are all his creation; deceptively simple, yet profound!
    </p>
    <p>
      While I have adapted it for my own purposes, if you visit his site (<a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/">here</a>)
      you will see just how unoriginal I am!  Thank you, Nicolas, not only for your excellent article (<a href="https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/GTD/index.html">"GET THINGS DONE WITH EMACS"</a>),
      but for your impeccable design, taste, and generousity.
